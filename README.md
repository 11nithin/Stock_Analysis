# Stock_Analysis

##Overview of the project

	Steve found the Daily volume and yearly return for each each stock. Although the code works well for a dozen stocks it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take along time to execute. In this project we are editing or refactoring the code to loop through all the data one time inorder to collect the same information. 


##Results

The code refactured and gives the same result. We had a timer set in the code to find the code running time. And its found for 2017 after refacturing the code, the code ran 4 times faster than previous code and for 2018 code ran 4.6 times faster than the previous code. This a great proof that a code can be written in multiple ways and its important to write the code in most efficicent way.
