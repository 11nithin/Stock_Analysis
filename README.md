# Stock_Analysis

## Overview of the project

Steve found the Daily volume and yearly return for each each stock. Although the code works well for a dozen stocks it might not work as well for thousands of stocks.
And if it does, it may take along time to execute. In this project we are editing or refactoring the code to loop through all the data one time inorder to collect the same information. 


## Results

The code refactured and gives the same result. We had a timer set in the code to find the code running time. And its found for 2017 after refacturing the code, the code ran 4 times faster than previous code and for 2018 code ran 4.6 times faster than the previous code. This a great proof that a code can be written in multiple ways and its important to write the code in most efficicent way.

## Summary
### Advantage of Refactoring the code in general 
 - Code runs  faster and efficiently 
 - Modifying the code in future is easy
 - All users can easily understand the code and troubleshoot if ran into any issue

### Disadvantage of Refactoring the code in general
 - Can be Time consuming 
 - Can run into error
- 
### Advantage and Disadvantage of Refactoring the Orginial Code
- Refactoring the original code made the code run 4 times faster. For larger dataset it would be very useful.  When ran it error it was frustating and time consuming, it came beneficial at the end. Our target was to achieve the output much efficient way to run larger dataset and we were able to acheive it.
